## Draft version of the MQ Online Training in Research Data Management module


A significant activity in this project has been the development of a “Research Data Management” online training module in collaboration with the Research Integrity Unit at Queensland University of Technology. This training module, which takes about an hour to complete, introduces the key concepts required for a researcher to apply the expected practices outlined in the Standards in Research Data Management, understand how best practice can lead to greater research integrity and impact and know where to find more resources or training. The training will initially be a component of mandatory training to all Higher Degree Research Students following which we intend to adapt the training for other researchers across the University.

The module reinforces the following key principles/obligations:

1. Research data is a valuable asset and careful planning preserves its value and leads to greater research impact.

2. There are certain requirements that need to be met when handling research data at Macquarie University.

3. Appropriate safety and security measures must be applied to data that contains sensitive information.

4. End-of-project publication/accession of data should occur following an “as open as possible, as closed as necessary” approach.

The training has a conversational, engaging tone and has been designed in Articulate Storyline 360 (e-learning software) which allowed us to create an interactive module encompassing a variety of e-learning approaches. It will be hosted in iLearn (the virtual learning environment and learning management system in place at Macquarie University). A mandatory assessment is also being hosted in iLearn which will have a required pass mark for HDR students.

Once the module has been user-tested it will be shared via an appropriate repository (CC-BY) for other Institutions to use or modify for their own purpose.
